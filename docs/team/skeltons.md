### Project: Bookopedia

Bookopedia is a desktop application specifically built for parcel delivery riders, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This enables delivery riders to be able to quickly plan their deliveries by typing in commands and still be able to view them in an organized manner.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
